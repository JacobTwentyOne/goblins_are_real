<h2><br>If you still dont belive me then how come there is video PROOF?<br> </h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OfyqFr3lo4">GOBlins are real.exe/malw</a>

This video here simply <br>PROVES<br> that they do exist and they are living among us...
<p> For far to long I have been supressed by the CIA and the Department of homeland security, they want to silence me for spreading the truth
    AND if you still don't belive me despite the fact that i never lie think about this one for a second.
    If goblins arn't real how come everytime I say the word goblin you picture the same little green man as everyone else? hmmm? 
    THAT is because goblins were <br>real<br> in the middleages and then went into hiding
